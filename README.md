* battle not implemented
* HP management not implemented

#### NOTES
* passing arguments to function paramaters
	* when passing a variable, it passes it by value. This makes a copy of the variable and performs on that copy.
	* when passing a vector/list, it is passed by reference. This means any change made to a vector/list will be permanent after a function execution.
